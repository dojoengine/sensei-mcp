When writing tests for Dojo systems, remember these critical points:

1. Testing types:
   - Unit tests: Test individual functions and models
   - Integration tests: Test entire systems and interactions

2. Running tests:
   - Use `sozo test` to run all tests in your project
   - Tests are identified by the #[test] attribute

3. Unit test best practices:
   - Include unit tests in the same file as the model/system
   - Use #[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... } to organize tests
   - Test all functions of your models
   - Use #[available_gas(amount)] to specify gas limits

4. Integration test structure:
   - Create tests in a separate directory
   - Define namespace_def() to specify resources
   - Define contract_defs() for permissions
   - Use spawn_test_world() to create test environment

5. Key testing functions:
   - world.read_model() to verify state
   - world.write_model_test() to set up test conditions
   - world.erase_model() to reset state
   - spawn_test_world() to create test environment
   - world.sync_perms_and_inits() to set up permissions

6. Always test:
   - Initial state
   - State changes after system calls
   - Error conditions with proper assertions
